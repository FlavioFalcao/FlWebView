FlWebView

QWebView is a very useful widget but it has two major annoyances:

1. When users drop stuff in a QWebView, the web view opens that something
2. QWebView by default does not open new windows

To solve both issues, a developer needs to extend QWebView with her
own subclass - which can be annoying.

FlWebView is a simple Qt class which extends QWebView and gives developers
the options to easily specify the behavior they want.

It also fix both annoyances by default.

Sample usage:

  // Get a web view that forbids dropping and opens new windows
  FlWebView wv;
  wv.load(QUrl("http://www.google.com"));
  wv.show();

  // allow dropping stuff into the web view
  wv.setOption(WV_IGNORE_DROPS, false);
